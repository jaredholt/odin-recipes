    <h3>What is Chilean Sea Bass</h3>

    <p>Chilean sea bass is actually a nickname for the Patagonian Toothfish. This 
       species of fish becomes oil rich in the cold waters of Antarctica which makes 
       it a delicious fish to cook and eat. It has a mild flavor, is full of rich 
       fatty acids, and is very easy to cook. One interesting fact is that while it 
       is a white fish similar to bass, it's not actually sea bass at all! It can be 
       quite pricey, but it's absolutely worth the splurge!</p>
