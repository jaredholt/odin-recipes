    <h3>What is an Eggs Bennedict?</h3>

    <p>Eggs Benedict is a traditional American breakfast and brunch recipe that originated 
        in New York City. It consists of an English muffin, cut in half, toasted, and topped
        with Canadian bacon, poached eggs, and classic French hollandaise sauce. It's decadent, 
        rich, and satisfying.People assume eggs benedict are of French origin because they use 
        Hollandaise Sauce (a popular French sauce), but it actually originated in New York, USA 
        at the Waldorf hotel when a customer requested the combination as a custom order, and the 
        restaurant was so impressed by it, they added it to their menu.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <h4>For Hollandaise Sauce</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Store the egg whites in an 
            airtight container in the fridge for another recipe.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolks to a small saucepan with water, lemon juice, and dijon, 
            and whisk until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter into small pieces and add them to the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Place the pot over medium-low heat, whisking the mixture constantly. 
            As the butter melts, it will get a little frothy. Continue whisking 
            constantly for about 3 minutes or until the mixture starts to thicken then 
            immediately remove from heat. It should be thick enough to coat the back of 
            a spoon.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and cayenne pepper, adding more seasoning to taste. Serve 
            right away or cover to keep warm. If the sauce gets too thick, whisk in a 
            teaspoon of warm water to loosen it up.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>For Eggs Benedict</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Prep for Poached Eggs: Place a pot of water with 1 Tbsp vinegar on the stove 
            for making poached eggs and bring it just to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Sauté meat: In a large skillet, sauté your meat until hot and golden then 
            transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Toast English muffins: Melt 2 tsp butter on the same skillet and add English 
            muffins cut-side down and toast until golden brown. Remove the skillet from the heat, 
            leaving the muffins in the skillet to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Poach Eggs: Once water is barely simmering, poach 4 eggs.</li>
        <li>Assemble: Place English muffin halves on serving plates cut-side up. Top with your 
            Canadian Bacon. Place the egg over the meat. Pour the hollandaise sauce over the eggs, 
            dividing the hollandaise recipe between the 4 eggs. Sprinkle the top with cayenne pepper 
            and garnish with chives. Serve immediately.</li>
